# -have-a-problem-with-Finder-in-FCPX
I have a problem with Finder in FCPX; I can't open or create a library. When I click 'Open Library', Finder does not start. I suspected a permissions issue, so I tried to grant FCPX full disk access in System Preferences under Security. However, when I click Add, Finder doesn't open, and I can't add FCPX. Is there a solution? My iMac model is A1419
